## 🎯 Selective Reading Rule (MANDATORY)

**Read REQUIRED files always, OPTIONAL only when needed:**

| File                                         | Status          | When to Read                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| [ux-psychology.md](ux-psychology.md)         | 🔴 **REQUIRED** | Always read first!                |
| [color-system.md](color-system.md)           | ⚪ Optional      | Color/palette decisions           |
| [typography-system.md](typography-system.md) | ⚪ Optional      | Font selection/pairing            |
| [visual-effects.md](visual-effects.md)       | ⚪ Optional      | Glassmorphism, shadows, gradients |
| [animation-guide.md](animation-guide.md)     | ⚪ Optional      | Animation needed                  |
| [motion-graphics.md](motion-graphics.md)     | ⚪ Optional      | Lottie, GSAP, 3D                  |
| [decision-trees.md](decision-trees.md)       | ⚪ Optional      | Context templates                 |

> 🔴 **ux-psychology.md = ALWAYS READ. Others = only if relevant.**

## 1. UX Psychology Principles

### Core Laws (Internalize These)

| Law | Principle | Application |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| **Hick's Law** | More choices = slower decisions | Limit options, use progressive disclosure |
| **Fitts' Law** | Bigger + closer = easier to click | Size CTAs appropriately |
| **Miller's Law** | ~7 items in working memory | Chunk content into groups |
| **Von Restorff** | Different = memorable | Make CTAs visually distinct |
| **Serial Position** | First/last remembered most | Key info at start/end |

### Emotional Design Levels

```
VISCERAL (instant)  → First impression: colors, imagery, overall feel
BEHAVIORAL (use)    → Using it: speed, feedback, efficiency
REFLECTIVE (memory) → After: "I like what this says about me"
```

### Trust Building

- Security indicators on sensitive actions
- Social proof where relevant
- Clear contact/support access
- Consistent, professional design
- Transparent policies

---

## 2. Layout Principles

### Golden Ratio (φ = 1.618)

```
Use for proportional harmony:
├── Content : Sidebar = roughly 62% : 38%
├── Each heading size = previous × 1.618 (for dramatic scale)
├── Spacing can follow: sm → md → lg (each × 1.618)
```

### 8-Point Grid Concept

```
All spacing and sizing in multiples of 8:
├── Tight: 4px (half-step for micro)
├── Small: 8px
├── Medium: 16px
├── Large: 24px, 32px
├── XL: 48px, 64px, 80px
└── Adjust based on content density
```

### Key Sizing Principles

| Element | Consideration |
|---------|---------------|
| **Touch targets** | Minimum comfortable tap size |
| **Buttons** | Height based on importance hierarchy |
| **Inputs** | Match button height for alignment |
| **Cards** | Consistent padding, breathable |
| **Reading width** | 45-75 characters optimal |

---

## 3. Color Principles

### 60-30-10 Rule

```
60% → Primary/Background (calm, neutral base)
30% → Secondary (supporting areas)
10% → Accent (CTAs, highlights, attention)
```

### Color Psychology (For Decision Making)

| If You Need... | Consider Hues | Avoid |
|----------------|---------------|-------|
| Trust, calm | Blue family | Aggressive reds |
| Growth, nature | Green family | Industrial grays |
| Energy, urgency | Orange, red | Passive blues |
| Luxury, creativity | Deep Teal, Gold, Emerald | Cheap-feeling brights |
| Clean, minimal | Neutrals | Overwhelming color |

### Selection Process

1. **What's the industry?** (narrows options)
2. **What's the emotion?** (picks primary)
3. **Light or dark mode?** (sets foundation)

## 4. Typography Principles

### Scale Selection

| Content Type | Scale Ratio | Feel |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| Dense UI | 1.125-1.2 | Compact, efficient |
| General web | 1.25 | Balanced (most common) |
| Editorial | 1.333 | Readable, spacious |
| Hero/display | 1.5-1.618 | Dramatic impact |

### Pairing Concept

```
Contrast + Harmony:
├── DIFFERENT enough for hierarchy
├── SIMILAR enough for cohesion
└── Usually: display + neutral, or serif + sans
```

### Readability Rules

- **Line length**: 45-75 characters optimal
- **Line height**: 1.4-1.6 for body text
- **Contrast**: Check WCAG requirements
- **Size**: 16px+ for body on web

## 5. Visual Effects Principles

### Glassmorphism (When Appropriate)

```
Key properties:
├── Semi-transparent background
├── Backdrop blur
├── Subtle border for definition
└── ⚠️ **WARNING:** Standard blue/white glassmorphism is a modern cliché. Use it radically or not at all.
```

### Shadow Hierarchy

```
Elevation concept:
├── Higher elements = larger shadows
├── Y-offset > X-offset (light from above)
├── Multiple layers = more realistic
└── Dark mode: may need glow instead
```

### Gradient Usage

```
Harmonious gradients:
├── Adjacent colors on wheel (analogous)
├── OR same hue, different lightness
├── Avoid harsh complementary pairs
├── 🚫 **NO Mesh/Aurora Gradients** (floating blobs)
└── VARY from project to project radically
```

## 6. Animation Principles

### Timing Concept

```
Duration based on:
├── Distance (further = longer)
├── Size (larger = slower)
├── Importance (critical = clear)
└── Context (urgent = fast, luxury = slow)
```

### Easing Selection

| Action | Easing | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Entering | Ease-out | Decelerate, settle in |
| Leaving | Ease-in | Accelerate, exit |
| Emphasis | Ease-in-out | Smooth, deliberate |
| Playful | Bounce | Fun, energetic |

### Performance

- Animate only transform and opacity
- Respect reduced-motion preference
- Test on low-end devices

## 7. "Wow Factor" Checklist

### Premium Indicators

- [ ] Generous whitespace (luxury = breathing room)
- [ ] Subtle depth and dimension
- [ ] Smooth, purposeful animations
- [ ] Attention to detail (alignment, consistency)
- [ ] Cohesive visual rhythm
- [ ] Custom elements (not all defaults)

### Trust Builders

- [ ] Security cues where appropriate
- [ ] Social proof / testimonials
- [ ] Clear value proposition
- [ ] Professional imagery
- [ ] Consistent design language

### Emotional Triggers

- [ ] Hero that evokes intended emotion
- [ ] Human elements (faces, stories)
- [ ] Progress/achievement indicators
- [ ] Moments of delight

---

## 8. Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### ❌ Lazy Design Indicators

- Default system fonts without consideration
- Stock imagery that doesn't match
- Inconsistent spacing
- Too many competing colors
- Walls of text without hierarchy
- Inaccessible contrast

### ❌ AI Tendency Patterns (AVOID!)

- **Same colors every project**
- **Dark + neon as default**
- **Purple/violet everything (PURPLE BAN ✅)**
- **Bento grids for simple landing pages**
- **Mesh Gradients & Glow Effects**
- **Same layout structure / Vercel clone**

### ❌ Dark Patterns (Unethical)

- Hidden costs
- Fake urgency
- Forced actions
- Deceptive UI
- Confirmshaming
